Hospital Management System Using HTML , CSS and PHP
Sure! Here's a brief introduction to HTML, CSS, and PHP:

### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used to create and design the structure of web pages. It defines the content and layout of a web page using elements represented by tags. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag, and they can nest within each other to create complex structures.

- **Basic Syntax:**
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to control the appearance of HTML elements. It allows developers to separate the content of a web page (HTML) from its design and layout. CSS can be applied inline, internally within a `<style>` tag in the HTML, or externally via a separate CSS file.

- **Basic Syntax:**
  ```css
  body {
      background-color: lightblue;
  }

  h1 {
      color: navy;
      margin-left: 20px;
  }
  ```

  When linked to an HTML document:
  ```html
  <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  ```

### PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)
PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is embedded within HTML and is used to generate dynamic page content, manage sessions, handle forms, and connect to databases. PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is sent to the browser as plain HTML.

- **Basic Syntax:**
  ```php
  <?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
  ?>
  ```

  When embedded in HTML:
  ```html
  <html>
  <body>
      <h1>My First PHP Page</h1>
      <?php
      echo "Hello, World!";
      ?>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

### Integration
These technologies often work together to create a complete web application. HTML provides the structure, CSS styles the content, and PHP handles the server-side logic.

- **Example:**
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1><?php echo "Welcome to my website!"; ?></h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph styled by CSS.</p>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

In this example, HTML is used for the structure, CSS for the styling, and PHP for dynamically generating the heading content. This combination allows for the creation of rich, interactive web applications.
