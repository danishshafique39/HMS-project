          <p>WE have developed a hospital management system. This system is designed for use by receptionists
             to schedule appointments and generate bills.  
             Furthermore, it provides receptionists with information about doctors and their specialties,
              enabling them to guide patients to appropriate doctors based on their medical conditions
